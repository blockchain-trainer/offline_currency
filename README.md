Conceptual Framework
Chameleon Hashes: A hash function with a trapdoor that allows the hash value to be modified by knowing a secret value (trapdoor).
Commitment Scheme: Allows a sender to commit to a value while keeping it hidden, with the ability to reveal the committed value later.
Value Transfer: Use chameleon hashes to transfer value securely. The sender commits to a value (amount) and sends a chameleon hash with the ability to modify it using a secret (trapdoor).
Spending: The recipient can modify the message using the trapdoor to spend the value at a later time.
